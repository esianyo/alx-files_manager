## utils

This directory contains utility modules for various functionalities used throughout the application.

**Current Modules:**

* Potentially:
    * `redis.js`: Provides methods for interacting with the Redis server (connection, key-value operations).
    * `db.js`: Provides methods for interacting with the MongoDB database (connection, document operations).

**Functionality:**

* Each module should be focused on a specific utility area (e.g., database interaction, file manipulation).
* Utility functions should be well-documented and reusable across different parts of the application.
* The code should follow consistent formatting and naming conventions for better readability.

**Benefits:**

* Improves code organization and separation of concerns.
* Promotes code reusability and reduces redundancy.
* Makes the codebase easier to maintain and understand.
